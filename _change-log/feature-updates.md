title: Feature Includes Updated
release: 2021-06-19
---

The [Feature Includes]({{ '/docs/pages/features/' | relative_url }}) have been redesigned and simplified.
These updates will make it easier to add collection items and external media to your content pages.
For a demonstration of **all** the include options, check out the new [Feature Includes Bonanza Page](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/feature_options.html)!

If you are migrating an existing project into a new template, you may encounter errors where the old includes do not exist. 
Search your project for {% raw %}`{% include feature/`{% endraw %} to find where to update the includes to the new version.
