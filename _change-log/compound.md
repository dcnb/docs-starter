title: Compound Objects Option Added
release: 2023-05-10
---

New display templates for "compound objects" have been added to CollectionBuilder-CSV (2023-05-10) and CollectionBuilder-GH (2023-05-30).
"Compound objects" are a concept used in some repository platforms to describe items that are made up of a set of digital files intended to be treated as one singular connected record in the system.
These types of items can now be added to CollectionBuilder projects by using the new display_template options and following the metadata conventions to represent your objects.

See the [Compound Objects docs section]({{ '/docs/metadata/compound-objects.html' | relative_url }}) or "docs/compound-objects.md" in the CB-CSV repository for full details.
