title: CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm Deprecated, use CSV!
release: 2023-11-03
---

The CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm template has been fully deprecated. 
CB-CDM has not been actively developed for years, and use cases are better served by the more powerful and flexible [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).
Details specific to CB-CDM have been removed from the main cb-docs (check the "docs" folder in the old template for reference).

*Existing projects using CB-CDM will continue to work fine!*
However, for all new projects please use CollectionBuilder-CSV.
