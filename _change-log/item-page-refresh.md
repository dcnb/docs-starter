title: Item Page Design Refresh
release: 2023-05-10
---

Default Item pages in CollectionBuilder-CSV and CollectionBuilder-GH have been refreshed.
Moving away from the two column layout divided between object representation and metadata, the new item pages feature a single column with larger object display followed by the metadata section.
This arrangement better highlights media items and makes the space more flexible for larger features, such as the panorama viewer.
A link button ("Item Info") still highlights and provides quick access to the metadata section.
