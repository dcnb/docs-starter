[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a modern programming language popular with web applications.

*You do not need to know anything about Ruby*, but you do need it to run Jekyll--and thus CollectionBuilder--on your system!

Like other programming languages, Ruby can be extended by adding 3rd party [libraries](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/libraries/) that can add functionality, features, or software to your system.
In the Ruby ecosystem these packages of code are called ["Gems"](https://rubygems.org/).
The command `gem` is used to install and manage Gems on your computer.

CollectionBuilder uses two main Gems, Jekyll and Bundler--these are pieces of software written in Ruby, that are installed using `gem`.
