[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is one of the most popular and actively developed static site generators, in part because of its direct integration with GitHub Pages.
Originally focused on creating simple blogs from Markdown files, it has developed into a fully featured generator used on all types of web projects from tiny to huge (browse the [Showcase](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

Jekyll is written in the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and is installed on your computer as a Ruby Gem.
However, *you don't need to know anything about Ruby to get started using it!*
