GitHub is a popular web platform for hosting Git repositories--i.e. a place to store and sync your project files online. 
Think of it as Google Drive for code with super robust "track changes" baked in.
Built around the powerful version control of Git, it provides a handy web interface for managing, editing, and collaborating on repositories.

Originally designed to manage large open-source software projects, GitHub's use has expanded to many other types of organizations and individuals, with over 40 million users. 
GitHub provides a bunch of built in project management features and services such as GitHub Actions (workflow automation) and GitHub Pages (static hosting).

To create a CollectionBuilder project you will need to set up a free account <https://github.com> and verify your email.

*Please note* that there are other version control systems (Subversion, mercurial, etc) and repository hosts ([Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), etc) out there... However, Git and GitHub are by far the most popular.
