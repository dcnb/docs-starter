[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a standard to simplify writing content for the web.
Considered a "lightweight" markup language, it provides a set of conventions to create documents in plain text that can be converted into HTML. 
The basics are intuitive, modeled after how you might naturally write an email, and are intended to be easy to read for a human (compared to HTML source code!).

Markdown comes in different "flavors" that provide additional features.
[GitHub flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (GFM) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.

Markdown parsers read your Markdown code and output HTML (or other formats), and may also extend the syntax options.
Jekyll uses the Ruby based [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to compile Markdown in HTML, which supports extra features such as [attribute lists](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#attribute-list-definitions).
