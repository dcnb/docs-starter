GitHub Pages is free static web hosting service available as part of every GitHub repository--this means with the click of a button you can fire up a new website!

Intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio or project documentation, GitHub Pages is an ideal solution for creating an open educational resource or personal site to highlight your academic work. 
Because hosting through gh-pages is free and builds valuable transferable skills, this is a great option for teaching and learning. 
Users have the opportunity to become creators and participants in global digital culture, developing critical digital literacy about the fabric of the web.

Many organizations and individuals are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public websites.
For example, [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), or this site!
