A GitHub organization is a useful tool to collaborate with a group *and/or* to brand, organize, and manage a set of related repositories. 
Orgs can help ensure continuity in situations when members may move on from a project or lab.
Or can be used just to provide a custom branded domain name for a project.

GitHub organizations are NOT a separate account, but are a group of users, i.e. you can't log in as an Org. 
One or more persons can be the Owner with full admin control over the org including managing members.

To start an organization, click the plus sign icon on the upper right of the GitHub menu bar and select "Create organization". 
Choose the "Free" account option, then give your org a good name (preferably lowercase with no spaces, since this will be used for your URLs). 
Once created, add members using their GitHub account names!

When creating a new repository, all members can use the "owner" dropdown option to create the repository under the organization (instead of their own account). 
Repositories owned by the Org will be accessible and managed by the Owner accounts. 
They stay with the Org even if the original creator leaves the Org.
Org repositories also enable more levels of access control than personal repos, which is especially important when working with collaborators.
