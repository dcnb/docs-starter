[Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a flexible template language.
[In Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} it allows you to layout pages built from modular components and data, using the "_includes", "_layouts", and "_data" directories.
Liquid includes features such as operators, loops, and filters to manipulate raw content. 
Liquid statements are enclosed by {% raw %}`{%  %}`{% endraw %} and variables in {% raw %}`{{  }}`{% endraw %}.
