# Edit Site Pages

With configuration options fleshed out, the next major step is to edit the content pages of your site.

CollectionBuilder templates come with a pre-configured "Home" page and skeleton "About" page which you will probably want to adjust to finish and polish your project.

You can also add any type of additional pages you might want. 
This is great for building out interpretive content, using your collection data to tell stories.
