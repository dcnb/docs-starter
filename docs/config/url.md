# URL Variables

This section of "_config.yml" is used to define the location where you will host the site on the live web.
These values are **optional for GH/Sheets users when deploying on GitHub Pages**!

Having `url` and `baseurl` configured correctly is essential for final deployment to get all your links and markup pointing to the right places.

### url: 

- `url` represents the url where the generated site will *eventually* reside on the web. It will be used to generate links when you build the site at the end of your customization process. Generally this matches your host domain or subdomain. The value should **not** end in a slash `/`.
- Setting a `url` value is **optional for GH/Sheets users** using default GitHub Pages hosting--the value will be commented out in the template's "_config.yml". When hosting on GitHub Pages, `url` will follow the pattern of `<your github user name>.github.io`
```yaml
url: https://dcnb.github.io
```
- If self hosting, the `url` will be the domain or subdomain where you will be placing the site.
```yaml
url: https://www.lib.uidaho.edu
```

### baseurl: 

- `baseurl` indicates the folder / path where your site will be located on your web server and **always** starts with a slash `/`. The value should **not** end in a slash.
- Setting a `baseurl` value is **optional for GH/Sheets users** using default GitHub Pages hosting--the value will be commented out in the template's "_config.yml". When hosting on GitHub Pages, `baseurl` will be the name of your project repository.
```yaml
baseurl: /example-collection
```
- If self hosting, the `baseurl` will be the folder where you would like to host the site (if applicable). For example, if you have a project called "*pink-poodle*" that you plan to put in the "*projects*" folder on your website, you'd put `/projects/pink-poodle` down for baseurl. 
```yaml 
# for site to be at https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/boxing
url: https://www.lib.uidaho.edu
baseurl: /digital/boxing
```
- If you site lives at the root of a domain (without a path), comment out `baseurl` or leave blank.

### source-code: 

- `source-code` is the full URL for the GitHub repository containing your CollectionBuilder project code. It is used to add a link back to your project repository. 
```yaml
source-code: https://github.com/exampleuser/interesting-project
```
