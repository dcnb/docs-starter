# Features you can include

We have a couple built in features you can use to include: 

- [alerts](#alerts)
- [buttons](#buttons)
- [images](#images)
- [videos](#videos)

## alerts

To include an alert you'll write; {% raw %}`{% include feature/alert.html text="Text you want included in the alert" color="info"%}{% endraw %}

{% include feature/alert.html text="Alert with color 'info'" color="info"%}

{% include feature/alert.html text="Alert with color 'primary'" color="primary"%}

{% include feature/alert.html text="Alert with color 'danger'" color="danger"%}

{% include feature/alert.html text="Alert with color 'warning'" color="warning"%}

## buttons

Buttons we often just use as links to other sections or out to other resources. 

To include a button you'll write; {% raw %}`{% include feature/button.html text="Button Text" color="info" link="https://example.com" %}{% endraw %}

{% include feature/button.html text="Link to Example.com" color="info" link="https://example.com" %}
