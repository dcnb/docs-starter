# CollectionBuilder Walkthroughs

These walkthroughs are step-by-step guides designed for beginners interested in using CollectionBuilder. Each walkthrough provides concrete, easy-to-follow steps for using a CollectionBuilder Template or completing a related task.

Keep in mind that the main docs are more comprehensive than the walkthroughs. If you are interested in learning more about a topic, you can browse through the main docs for more in-depth explanations or click on the links to further resources in the walkthroughs.
