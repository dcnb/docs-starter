# Set Up Project Repository

To start your new project you will be making a copy of the CollectionBuilder template to use as a base.
There are many ways to do this--however, GitHub's web interface makes the set up process straight forward, getting you prepped with version control to manage your project and code in just a few clicks.

If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub here is the super quick overview:

- **Git** is a version control system used for tracking the files 
- a **Repository** is a folder of files for a project tracked by Git
- **GitHub** is an online platform for collaborating on repositories

*Note:* using other platforms such as [GitLab]({{ '/docs/advanced/gitlab/' | relative_url }}) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (or no version control at all) is definitely possible, but is not covered directly in these docs.
