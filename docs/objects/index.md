# Collection Objects

Most (*but not all!*) CollectionBuilder projects will involve working with a collection of digital objects, i.e. JPEGs, PDFs, MP3s, etc.

How you prepare, organize, and host these objects depends on the type of CB template you are using. 
This section provides an overview of the different approaches to handling object files and details for each template.
