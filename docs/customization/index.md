# Configure and Customize Pages

A variety of CollectionBuilder's navigation features and visualization pages are configured via "config" CSV files. 
Look in your project's "_data" directory for the series of CSVs with the prefix "config-". 

These configs tend to be more detailed than the page options set in the ["theme.yml" file]({{ '/docs/theme/' | relative_url }}).

Since the CSVs are relatively small and simple, we recommend editing them directly in your text editor, but Google Sheets or LibreOffice will also work. 
If you're using VS Code, adding the [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) plugin is helpful for reading CSVs in plain text format.
