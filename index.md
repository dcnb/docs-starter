# CollectionBuilder Docs

CollectionBuilder was designed with learning in mind--and so are these docs!

CollectionBuilder's workflow is scaffolded in order to help users build web and data literacy skills as they progress towards building and deploying new digital exhibits. 
To that end, we've worked hard to make this documentation comprehensible for the novice user moving through the sections step by step, as well as, useful for more advanced users searching for specific content.

We hope you will find everything needed to create a CollectionBuilder project--but also learn the techniques of a static web approach that can power many other types of projects!
And if you run into issues or have questions don't hesitate to ask!
